IWNxT-Client
============

Client code used to demonstrate the usage of the IWNxT library.

IWNxT-Client is part of the IWNxT project created in 2011.
To run the client, you NEED to have the library. The library code is not open-source and binaries are not public.

The IWNxT library is a reproduction of the Steam API which helps developers to add new functionalities 
to their games such as a friend system, an invitation system and so on...
The IWNxT code is not public because it contains reverse engineered code from the original Steam API.

You can reuse this code for your projects, it only works on Windows.
I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 to compile this code.
